## Overview

Churn prediction is the task of identifying customers who are likely to cancel their subscription or services. In the telecom industry, this can help companies take proactive steps to retain customers by offering promotions, discounts, or personalized incentives.

In this project, we use Logistic Regression, a commonly used machine learning algorithm, to predict churn. Logistic Regression is suitable for binary classification tasks like churn prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](link_to_dataset). It contains the following columns:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- ...
- Churn (Target Variable)

Please download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction-telecom.git
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd churn-prediction-telecom
```

2. Train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model by running the following command:

```bash
python churn_prediction.py
```

3. You can customize the model hyperparameters and preprocessing steps in the `churn_prediction.py` script.

4. View the results and model performance metrics in the console.

## Results

We achieved the following results with our Logistic Regression model:

- Accuracy: 80%
- Precision: 67%
- Recall: 67%
- roc auc:85 %

These results indicate the model's performance in predicting churn.
